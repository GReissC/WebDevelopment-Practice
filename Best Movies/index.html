    <h1>My Top 3 Movies</h1>
    <h2>Top 3 best movies according to myself</h2>
<hr>
    <h3>Pixels</h3>
    <p>Very fun movie in the theme of 80s and 90s pop culture in a classic Adam Sandler style. 8/10</p>

    <h3>Coco</h3>
    <p>Beautiful movie depicting the mexican culture in a way that doesn't feel stereotypical. 9/10</p>

    <h3>The Nutty Professor (2008)</h3>
    <p>A more children-friendly and animated take on the story of "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde", although it's pretty dated. 6/10 for normal people, 9/10 for me due to nostalgia.</p>
